# Quick Start Guide

Get started with your API learning journey in 3 simple steps!

## Step 1: Read the Documentation (15 minutes)

Read these files in order:
1. `README.md` - Understand what you're building
2. `PROJECT_DEFINITION.md` - See the complete project scope
3. `ROADMAP.md` - Review your learning path

## Step 2: Check Prerequisites (5 minutes)

Make sure you have:
- [ ] Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] Administrator/sudo access to install software
- [ ] A text editor (VS Code recommended)

## Step 3: Start Module 1 (2-3 hours)

Navigate to: `modules/MODULE_01_Understanding_APIs.md`

This module teaches you:
- What APIs are
- How they work
- Why we need them
- Basic concepts

## Your First Day Plan

**Time**: 3-4 hours

1. Read README and project docs (30 min)
2. Complete Module 1 theory (1 hour)
3. Install Python and tools (30 min - Module 2)
4. Create your first "Hello World" API (1 hour)
5. Test it in your browser (15 min)

## After Your First Session

You will have:
- ✓ A working API running on your computer
- ✓ Understanding of what APIs are
- ✓ Confidence to continue learning
- ✓ A development environment ready

## Daily Learning Routine

Recommended approach:
1. Dedicate 1-2 hours per day
2. Complete one module at a time
3. Don't skip the practice exercises
4. Take breaks every 45 minutes
5. Review previous concepts before new ones

## Need Help?

While learning:
- Read error messages carefully
